# MoreGatesExtended
[MoreGates](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1087) mod originally created by LordHayze. Localization support, configurable recipes, disableable pieces.

Some pieces are disabled by default as it duplicates the vanilla parts. Clear related config value if your build already has them.

Recipes are configurable. It isn't done in a handy way. But it works.

You can change category and tool which is used to build. You can't change category for single piece.
